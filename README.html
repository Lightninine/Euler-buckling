<h1>Euler-buckling</h1>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
A vertical beam submitted to a vertical force can exhibit an instability.  <br/> 
The critical load for instability depends on the end conditions of the beam.   <br/>
The picture displays fours different end conditions.   <br/>

The Euler buckling problem is formulated as a constrained optimization.   <br/>
The total energy, potential + deformation, is minimum for stable equilibrium.<br/>
The constraints are the end conditions and the geometric equations of the beam.<br/>

<p>In the four demo Jupyter notebook, this is done using the   <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Optimization-Modeling-Python-Springer-Applications/dp/3319588192/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503778130&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pyomo">Pyomo Optimization Modeling in Python</a>   package.<br/>
Four cases are considered, as in the picture from left to:</p>

<ul>
<li>PP: pinned below, pinned above</li>
<li>CP: clamped below, pinned above</li>
<li>CC: clamped below, clamped above</li>
<li>CF: clamped below, free above</li>
</ul>

<b>Dependencies</b>
<p>Pyomo and Ipopt, for optimization, are installed automatically from the notebooks if needed.<br/>
Bokeh and Holoviews, for graphics, need to be installed beforehands.</p>
